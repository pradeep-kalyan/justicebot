# DOJ-Bot

an AI chatbot for the Department of Justice (DoJ) website. This chatbot will use advanced NLP and ML to efficiently answer user queries about DoJ services and legal information. Here‚Äôs a summary of the project:

### Key Features:

1. **Up-to-date Information**: Provides current information and answers to user queries.
2. **Guidance**: Helps users with processes like e-filing and paying fines.
3. **Learning and Improvement**: Continuously learns and improves over time.
4. **Multilingual Support**: Handles queries in multiple languages.
5. **User Satisfaction**: Focuses on user satisfaction and scalability.

### Technologies/Services Used:

- **Python**
- **ChromaDB**
- **LangChain**
- **Hugging Face**
- **Flask**
- **JSON**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Cryptography**

### Data Sources:

- **Custom Data**
- **Scraped Data from DoJ**
- **Fine-tuned Model**

### Challenges:

- **Accuracy**: Ensuring the chatbot provides accurate information.
